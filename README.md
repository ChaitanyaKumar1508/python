## Introduction

- Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991
- Simple to code, its aim is to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects
- It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming
- Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks




## Versions

- Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3
- The Python 2 language, i.e. Python 2.7.x, was officially discontinued on 1 January 2020 (first planned for 2015) after which security patches and other improvements will not be released for it.[32][33] With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x[34] and later are supported.
